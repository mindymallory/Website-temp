abstract = "This study estimates the cost of forward contracting corn and soybeans for January and March delivery from 1980 through 2009. Both corn and soybeans exhibited a downward trend in the cost of forward contracting for January delivery, in contrast to previous pre-harvest results, and the March delivery cost of forward contracting is slightly downward sloped. The cost of post-harvest forward contracting corn and soybeans averaged 2 cents and 6 cents respectively; this was much less than the cost of pre-harvest forward contracting in recent years. We did not find an increase in cost associated with income shifting associated with January delivery. We conclude that January forward contracts offer a relatively inexpensive means of smoothing income across years."
